# OpenGTAP
OpenGTAP provides open-source tooling for the GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project) Model on the .NET Framework.

![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/austindrenski/OpenGTAP?svg=true)[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/austindrenski/OpenGTAP.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/austindrenski/OpenGTAP)

## Libraries

- [HeaderArrayConverter](https://github.com/austindrenski/OpenGTAP/blob/master/HeaderArrayConverter/README.md)

## Current status
- The HeaderArrayConverter project is working on a data interchange format for the binary HAR and SL4 files.
    - Binary HAR and SL4 files can be read into memory.
    - In-memory representation can be serialized into a series of JSON files that are zipped into a HARX file.
    - HARX (zipped JSON) files can be read into memory.
    - In-memory representations of HAR, SL4, and HARX files can be written back to binary HAR files.
    
- Planning is underway for a lightweight cross-platform viewer application (ViewHARX?) capable of reading and writing HAR, SL4, and HARX files.

## The idea
The GTAP model provides a popular framework for conducting global economic analysis. Currently, the model is written in the GEMPACK (General Equilibrium Modeling PACKage) modeling software. This project is exploring areas in which open-source tooling can be developed to bring the standard GTAP model to the .NET Standard Framework.

OpenGTAP does not replace the standard GTAP model. Rather, it aims provide a modern, object-oriented tooling to encourage new developments from the open-source community.

## Potential areas for modernization
Working with C# 7 and targeting the .NET Standard Framework version 2.0, OpenGTAP seeks to simplify and build upon the standard model. 

The OpenGTAP team suspects that the following areas may see a performance benefit from modern abstractions: 
* HAR (Header Array) files could be replaced with a modern and accessible data format.
* Class systems could simplify the aggregation/disaggregation workflow that currently exists, making model customization simpler at the source code level.
* Data parallelism via the PLINQ (Parallel LINQ) library may simplify the data pipeline between model instantiation and computation. 
* The introduction of PLINQ-style abstractions could improve the readability of computationally intensive codeâ€”even if that code is itself not a candidate for parallelization.
